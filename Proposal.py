The Client Value Framework is how we sell, shape and talk about our deals. 
It provides an outline for Oral Presentations and written Executive Summaries. 
It requires a client-first focus. 
We must understand and validate our understanding of their current/future plans, their challenges, and their expectations from a partner. 
The first 5 steps for Client Value Framework focusses on -
1. Client Mission: The client‚Äôs market-facing message, branding
2. Defined business outcomes and goals: Current state of business, operations and IT environments
4. What prevents future state from happening
5. Key Capabilities Required to Succeed:
6. Corporate Profile(s) & Credentials (including Partners): Our Corporate summary and 3rd Party testimonials to our efficacy (analysis, other clients, etc.)
